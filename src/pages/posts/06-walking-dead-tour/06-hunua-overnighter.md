title: 'Hunua Overnighter'
excerpt: We’re up and ready to climb New Zealand’s only Hors Category (HC) road. We were, and continue to be surprised that the Ohakune to Turoa climb is NZ’s only HC climb. When you think of all of the other mountain roads there are throughout NZ, it’s a little surprising.
