I arrived in New York on the evening of Friday 3rd of May, and it had been raining non-stop for 3 days straight. The forecast finally looked dry the following Tuesday. [Tiffany Tu](https://www.instagram.com/tifftuu/) organised a group ride to Piermont and I RSVPed almost immediately because I had been itching for a ride to explore the roads of New York. We met up near <marker-link lat='40.651381' lng='-73.971898' label='A' zoom='14'>Prospect Park</marker-link> the next morning.

First thing we did was stop by at Rapha New York and get acquainted over morning coffee. Tiffany works for Rapha as a ride leader so she's the perfect local guide to all things cycling in this city. She also shared with me some protips about living & riding in New York – Come to Rapha to for hosing down your bike, because my apartment building doesn't have any bike cleaning facilities. After coffee we made our way to George Washington Bridge, where we're linked up with Tiffany's cycling buddy — [Martin](https://www.instagram.com/martinlau_/).

The thrill of the ride began as soon as we left Rapha. We weaved through traffic, dodged oblivious pedestrians crossing the bike lane, bunny hopped potholes and swerved around broken glass, all within the first few kilometers. This is New York after all, if there was one thing I took away from the countless rewatch of [Premium Rush](https://letterboxd.com/film/premium-rush/) and [Terry Barentsen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHRUAMAzVUS_Szvxn55GXaQ) – red lights do not apply to cyclists (sans-police), and cheating death is a NYC addiction.

We're responsible adults though, so quickly made our way to civilized bike lanes of the [Hudson River Greenway](http://www.nycbikemaps.com/maps/manhattan-waterfront-greenway-bike-map/), along the <marker-link lat='40.725877' lng='-74.010921' label='C' zoom='13'>West side</marker-link> of Manhattan

## George Washington Bridge
After 15km of bike lane along the Hudson River, we met up with [Martin](https://www.instagram.com/martinlau_/), and crossed <marker-link lat='40.849610' lng='-73.942614' label='D' zoom='13'>George Washington Bridge</marker-link> into a <marker-link lat='40.852618' lng='-73.962051' label='E' zoom='13'>lookout</marker-link> point at Fort Lee, New Jersey.

## Alpine, New Jersey
We then took a turn into a route under the bridge. It was free of traffic, with abundant greenery surrounding us. This was the complete opposite of the concrete jungle I have heard & seen so much of. I can only imagine the seasonly variations this route will have throughout the year, I must come back and ride through fall & winter.

60 km in, after some light gravel, we reached <marker-link lat='41.042807' lng='-73.919393' label='F' zoom='13'>Piermont</marker-link>, a quant village in upstate, NY. We stopped for a big, carb heavy lunch. I couldn't resist the urge to down a mid-day beer before we steadily made our way back home to Brooklyn.
