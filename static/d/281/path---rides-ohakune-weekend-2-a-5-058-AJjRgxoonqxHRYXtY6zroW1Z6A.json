It is 335.7 km from Wellington, at the foot of Ruapehu, in northern Manawatu-Wanganui (central North Island), between National Park and Ohakune.\n\nIt was built between 1905 and 1908 for the Public Works Department (PWD), who passed it to New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) in 1909\n\nWhen built it was tallest, and is now the third tallest, viaduct in New Zealand, the higher ones being the 1981 North Rangitikei 81 metres, further south on the NIMT, and 1937 Mohaka viaduct 95 metres, on the Gisborne line.\n\n# Ohakune\n\nSettlement of the town is considered to have commenced in the early 1890s and by March 1908 the railway line had reached Ohakune.The period of railway construction activities was followed quickly by intensive timber milling; as the forest was cleared, cattle and sheep were introduced and farming progressed. Ohakune was constituted a town district in August 1908 and in November 1911 attained borough status.\n\nThe meaning of the name Ohakune in the Māori language is “the place of” (Ō) “the careful ones” (hakune).\n\nKnown for it’s skiing, it’s also worth checking Ohakune out in the Summer. The roads south are great for road cycling. There’s also plenty of mountain biking to be had. It’s Home of the Ohakune Old Coach Road and the starting point for the Mountains to Sea cycle trail.\n\nThere’s plenty of great accommodation in Ohakune, but I’d recommend staying close to the town centre. It has a great heart, and the locals are friendly.\n\n<div class=\"pa4 tc bg-near-white lh-body f5 near-black\">\nThis entry was originally posted <a href=\"http://greylynncycleclub.com/ohakune-weekend-stage-1/\">here</a>\n</div> "}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ohakune Weekend","location":"Ohakune, Mt Ruapehu","excerpt":"So the Ohakune weekend Stage 1 was upon us.
