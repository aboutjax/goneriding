The only positive from all of carrying tubes is that we obviously scared the puncture demons away.

A little tail wind, not too cold, and this time we had a group of seven riders. Then we hit the desert road. From here until just after the central plateau it all turned to shit. It started to rain. The wind was now wrapping around the mountain and offering us a headwind. The road surface is unkind to cyclists, even more so with roadworks.

Guy too cold to change gears with his fingers. He’d decided to brave the cold in just a jersey. Mad, simply mad, I tell you.

Headed straight for the nearest café. Breakfast and multiple coffees, all of which were pretty top notch. Trying to eat whilst shivering was proving a problem. Guy looked hypothermic. That warmed me up, knowing I wasn’t the coldest in our group. We had to make a decision. Would we be able to make 330km, or should we be sensible and cut it short! The answer was proving difficult to find. I made the executive decision that we should just abandon our dreams of reaching 330. Let’s just cut it short and let sanity prevail. As soon as it was suggested that we would cut it short everyone agreed in haste."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tuarangi and onwards"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We finally left the café, and rode off towards Te Pihanga Saddle Road, state highway 47. It’s a 6km climb at 7%. We last tackled this climb at 240km. This time we are tackling it at 93km. That made one hell of a difference. My legs felt fresh, although my heart rate didn’t suggest that. The rain made an appearance once again. It wasn’t welcome. I continued up the hill as to not slow the group down. They visited the scenic lookout. This bought me enough time to make it to the top and down the other side before they rejoined. A crafty move it could be said, especially for the Strava data. That didn’t matter though."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We regrouped and made our way to National Park.
