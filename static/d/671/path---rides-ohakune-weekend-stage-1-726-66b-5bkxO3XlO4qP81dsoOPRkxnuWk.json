The usual quietness instilled. No one really talks much at that time in the morning, much less when they are preparing for a very long ride. The usual was had for breakfast.

Nervous chatter. Chatter about doing 330km. We’d all discussed about carrying less equipment, and share the load. But in the silence no one broached the subject, so we all ended up carrying 2 tubes, gas, levers and tools. The only positive from all of carrying tubes is that we obviously scared the puncture demons away. We had just one puncture the whole day, and that happened early on."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h3","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Ride"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"It all started out so well. A little tail wind, not too cold, and this time we had a group of seven riders. Then we hit the desert road. From here until just after the central plateau it all turned to shit. It started to rain. The wind was now wrapping around the mountain and offering us a headwind. The road surface is unkind to cyclists, even more so with roadworks. Although the shoulder is wide in places, it’s non-existent in others. When dealing with trucks it makes it especially scary."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As soon as we reached the summit of the desert road, we cruised down to Tuarangi. A gentle roll at 40kph for 30 km. The feeling of reaching the highest point of the ride can’t be over exaggerated. It was here that the rain finally stopped for a while. We were frozen. Guy too cold to change gears with his fingers. He’d decided to brave the cold in just a jersey. Mad, simply mad, I tell you. The rest of us at least had a jacket."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We arrived in Tuarangi. Headed straight for the nearest café. Breakfast and multiple coffees, all of which were pretty top notch. Trying to eat whilst shivering was proving a problem. Guy looked hypothermic. That warmed me up, knowing I wasn’t the coldest in our group. We had to make a decision. Would we be able to make 330km, or should we be sensible and cut it short! The answer was proving difficult to find. I made the executive decision that we should just abandon our dreams of reaching 330. Let’s just cut it short and let sanity prevail. As soon as it was suggested that we would cut it short everyone agreed in haste."}]}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ohakune Weekend Stage 1","excerpt":"So the Ohakune weekend Stage 1 was upon us.
