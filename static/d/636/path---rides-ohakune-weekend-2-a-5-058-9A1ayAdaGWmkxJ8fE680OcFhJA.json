A gentle roll at 40kph for 30 km. The feeling of reaching the highest point of the ride can’t be over exaggerated. It was here that the rain finally stopped for a while. We were frozen. Guy too cold to change gears with his fingers. He’d decided to brave the cold in just a jersey. Mad, simply mad, I tell you. The rest of us at least had a jacket.\n\n![Desert Road](IMG_0913.jpg 'Desert road.')\n\nWe arrived in Tuarangi. Headed straight for the nearest café. Breakfast and multiple coffees, all of which were pretty top notch. Trying to eat whilst shivering was proving a problem. Guy looked hypothermic. That warmed me up, knowing I wasn’t the coldest in our group. We had to make a decision. Would we be able to make 330km, or should we be sensible and cut it short! The answer was proving difficult to find. I made the executive decision that we should just abandon our dreams of reaching 330. Let’s just cut it short and let sanity prevail. As soon as it was suggested that we would cut it short everyone agreed in haste. "},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"comment","value":" # Tuarangi and onwards\n\nWe finally left the café, and rode off towards Te Pihanga Saddle Road, state highway 47. It’s a 6km climb at 7%. We last tackled this climb at 240km. This time we are tackling it at 93km. That made one hell of a difference. My legs felt fresh, although my heart rate didn’t suggest that. The rain made an appearance once again. It wasn’t welcome. I continued up the hill as to not slow the group down. They visited the scenic lookout. This bought me enough time to make it to the top and down the other side before they rejoined. A crafty move it could be said, especially for the Strava data. That didn’t matter though.\n\nWe regrouped and made our way to National Park. A café and food beckoned. We could smell coffee. And with a good tailwind now playing its part, we knocked off the next 45km pretty quickly. National Park couldn’t come soon enough. Although we’d eaten only 3 hours previously, too soon for some, we all dived in and fed our souls.\n\n![Refueling at cafe](IMG_9488.jpg 'Refueling at cafe.')\n\nEveryone was a little warmer and happier, now. We were fed and watered. The weather had improved. From National Park all the way to Ohakune we’d be gifted a tail wind. Absolute bliss. We raced along highway 4 towards the Makatote Viaduct railway bridge. We stopped to take some fresh team jersey pics. A great backdrop and well earned rest. The bridge is an absolute stunner. If you’re ever in the area it’s worth stopping and checking out.\n\n![Makatote Viaduct railway bridge](IMG_9500.jpg 'Makatote Viaduct railway bridge')\n\n# The final dash\n\nThe final dash for Ohakune was a smashfest. All guns blazing we roared to the finish. A smash for the line as we finished the final stage of the day. Glory was ours. Onto the pub, well, café (again).\n\nA dash to the old railway station for some more GLCC jersey pics, and our journey was nearly over. Although it was cut short, we felt this was the best decision for everyone. A night in the Powderkeg made sure of that. Everyone had a few beers and then it was straight to sleep, ready for the Turoa TT the next day.\n\n![Giant TCR](giant_tcr.jpg 'Giant TCR')\n![Ohakune Train Station](IMG_3485.jpg 'Ohakune Train Station') "},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"comment","value":"\n# Makatote Viaduct\n\nThe Makatote Viaduct (Bridge 179) takes the North Island Main Trunk railway (NIMT) across the Makatote River. It is 335.7 km from Wellington, at the foot of Ruapehu, in northern Manawatu-Wanganui (central North Island), between National Park and Ohakune.\n\nIt was built between 1905 and 1908 for the Public Works Department (PWD), who passed it to New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) in 1909\n\nWhen built it was tallest, and is now the third tallest, viaduct in New Zealand, the higher ones being the 1981 North Rangitikei 81 metres, further south on the NIMT, and 1937 Mohaka viaduct 95 metres, on the Gisborne line.\n\n# Ohakune\n\nSettlement of the town is considered to have commenced in the early 1890s and by March 1908 the railway line had reached Ohakune.The period of railway construction activities was followed quickly by intensive timber milling; as the forest was cleared, cattle and sheep were introduced and farming progressed. Ohakune was constituted a town district in August 1908 and in November 1911 attained borough status.\n\nThe meaning of the name Ohakune in the Māori language is “the place of” (Ō) “the careful ones” (hakune).\n\nKnown for it’s skiing, it’s also worth checking Ohakune out in the Summer. The roads south are great for road cycling. There’s also plenty of mountain biking to be had. It’s Home of the Ohakune Old Coach Road and the starting point for the Mountains to Sea cycle trail.\n\nThere’s plenty of great accommodation in Ohakune, but I’d recommend staying close to the town centre. It has a great heart, and the locals are friendly.\n\n<div class=\"pa4 tc bg-near-white lh-body f5 near-black\">\nThis entry was originally posted <a href=\"http://greylynncycleclub.com/ohakune-weekend-stage-1/\">here</a>\n</div> "}],"data":{"quirksMode":false}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ohakune Weekend","location":"Ohakune, Mt Ruapehu","excerpt":"So the Ohakune weekend Stage 1 was upon us.
